## Don't discuss but give a taste

- "X was greater than Y, thus suggesting that our hypothesis was correct"

- "We found an important increase of 25% on X when compared to Y"

- "Species diversity in habitat A was 2.3 higher than in habitat B, thus suggesting a positive effect of habitat feature X"
