## It is a statement
- It is affirmative
- It is not a questions
- Must lead to expectations if confirmed
- Self-explanatory

### What is the cause of *aurora borealis*?{.center}

### This is the manifestation of joy of the Gods<br> that throw some bright blanket in the night sky

### Auroras result from emissions of photons in Earth's upper <br> atmosphere, above 80 km (50 mi), from ionized nitrogen <br> atoms regaining an electron, and oxygen atoms and <br>nitrogen  based molecules returning from an excited state<br> to ground state


## Types of hypotheses

::::{.columns}
:::{.column}
**Scientific Hypotheses**

- Candidate statements to explain an observed phenomenon
- Meant to generate logical predictions
- Working guidelines

:::

:::{.column .fragment}
**Statistical Hypotheses**

- Logical predictions
- Confirmed by stats
- Can be drawn in a graph

## Statistical hypotheses

## Let's train a bit

Given the question: What caused the increase in body mass during the evolution of horses?

### Create both a *scientific* and a *statistical* <br>hypotheses about the size of horses

## A good working hypothesis is everything

- A wrong hypotheses will misguide you
- A good hypothesis will keep you excited and up to date.
- Needs training

## How to write hypotheses?

 - You should tell a story
 - Don't use a subheading
 - Never reefer to statistical hypotheses
 
## The "If/then" method

 - *If* drug X have an effect on reducing headache, *then*
 - *When* many exotic species are introduced in the ecosystem, *then* the likelihood of severe ecological disruption increases
 
## The *statement* method

- Drug X reduce the headaches because it blocks the neuroreceptors of pain
- Exotic species in high quantities disrupts ecological mutualistic networks

## How good is my hypothesis?
:::{.incremental}

- Testable? :smiley:
- Objective? :smiley:
- Relevant? :smiley:
