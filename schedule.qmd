All the lessons live here, grouped by weeks.
  * [**Preparation**] - Every week starts here with a few steps to set up the basics in terms of `packages` and `readings`.
  * [**Session**] - Here you'll find the **slides** and **recorded videos** focused on the core learning outcomes
  * [**Exercise**] - This is your post-sesssion, auto-learning hours of study and must be organized in your Quarto workbook.
