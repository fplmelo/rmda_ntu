## You should know today:

- Understand the basics of the logic of scientific thinking
- Use this logic to address you research
- Relate: questions, hypotheses & prediction


## How science works?

## Get used to a workflow
:::{.frament}

1) Question: How can climate location affect sexual dimorphism in penguins?
2) Hypothesis: Colder temperature leads to larger bodies thus reducing dimorphism
3) Prediction: Penguins in colder island have similar body measures
:::


## Let's check it out

```{r}
#| echo: false
penguins |> 
  mutate(temp=ifelse(body_mass_g<3600, "hotter", "colder")) |> 
  na.omit() |> 
  ggplot(aes(temp, body_mass_g, color=sex, fill=sex))+
  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.7)
```

## Your turn

1) Make a question
2) Create a hypothesis
3) Draw a prediction

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(countdown)
countdown(minutes = 2, seconds = 00)

```

## Workflow [(from wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetico-deductive_model)
:::{.incremental}
- 1- Based on observation, previous collected data and literature, find a knowledge gap

- 2- Form a hypothesis that explains the phenomenon

- 3- Deduce some expected patterns, assuming your hypotheses is **true**

- 4- Design a experiment to test your hypothesis
