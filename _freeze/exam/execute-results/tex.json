You may use any resources available to you (notes, books, online documentation).\n\n-   You are expected to work individually. Collaboration is not permitted.\n\n-   All code and answers should be clearly presented in this document.\n\n-   Ensure this document renders successfully to a PDF file.\n\n-   Show all your work, including the R code used to arrive at your answers. Partial credit may be awarded.\n\n-   Pay attention to the specific questions asked and provide concise and relevant answers.\n\n-   This exam uses pre-built R datasets. You do not need to load any external data.\n\n# Section 1: Data Wrangling This section uses the mtcars dataset, which contains data about various car models.\n\nQuestion 1 ([Insert Points Here])\n\n# Load the mtcars dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Inspect the dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nglimpse(mtcars) head(mtcars) summary(mtcars)\n\nYour written answer for Question 1 goes here.\n\nQuestion 2 ([Insert Points Here])\n\nThe am column in the mtcars dataset represents the transmission type (0 = automatic, 1 = manual). Create a new factor variable called transmission_type based on the am column.\n\n# Create transmission_type\n\nmtcars \\<- mtcars %\\>% mutate( transmission_type = factor(am, labels = c(\"Automatic\", \"Manual\")) ) \\# print(table(mtcars\\$transmission_type))\n\nYour written answer for Question 2 goes here.\n\nQuestion 3 ([Insert Points Here])\n\nCalculate the mean mpg (miles per gallon) for cars with 4 cylinders (cyl) and for cars with 6 cylinders.\n\n# Calculate mean mpg for 4 and 6 cylinder cars\n\nmtcars %\\>% filter(cyl %in% c(4, 6)) %\\>% group_by(cyl) %\\>% summarise(mean_mpg = mean(mpg))\n\nYour written answer for Question 3 goes here.\n\nQuestion 4 ([Insert points here])\n\nFilter the data to include only observations where the car has a manual transmission and has more than 4 gears. How many observations meet these criteria?\n\nmanual_and_more_than_4_gears \\<- mtcars %\\>% filter(am == 1 & gear \\> 4) nrow(manual_and_more_than_4_gears)\n\nYour answer here\n\nSection 2: Data Visualization This section continues to use the mtcars dataset.\n\nQuestion 5 ([Insert Points Here])\n\nCreate a scatter plot showing the relationship between mpg and wt (weight). Add appropriate labels for the axes and a title for the plot.\n\n# Create scatter plot of mpg vs wt\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + labs(title = \"Relationship between MPG and Weight\", x = \"Weight (1000 lbs)\", y = \"MPG\")\n\n*Your written answer for Question 5 goes here.*\n\nQuestion 6 ([Insert Points Here])\n\nGenerate a boxplot to visualize the distribution of mpg across different cyl (number of cylinders) values.\n\n# Create boxplot of mpg by cyl\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = \"MPG Distribution by Number of Cylinders\", x = \"Number of Cylinders\", y = \"MPG\")\n\n*Your written answer for Question 6 goes here.*\n\nQuestion 7 ([Insert Points Here])\n\nCreate a bar chart showing the count of cars for each number of cylinders (cyl).\n\n# Create bar chart of cylinder counts\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) + geom_bar() + labs(title = \"Car Count by Number of Cylinders\", x = \"Number of Cylinders\", y = \"Count\")\n\n*Your written answer for Question 7 goes here.*\n\nSection 3: Basic Statistics This section uses the mtcars dataset.\n\nQuestion 8 ([Insert Points Here])\n\nPerform an independent samples t-test to compare the mean mpg for cars with automatic and manual transmissions. State the null and alternative hypotheses, report the p-value, and interpret the results.\n\n# Perform t-test\n\nt.test(mpg \\~ am, data = mtcars)\n\n*Your written answer for Question 8 goes here.*\n\nQuestion 9 ([Insert Points Here])\n\nCalculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between mpg and hp (horsepower). Interpret the strength and direction of the correlation.\n\n# Calculate correlation\n\ncor(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp)\n\n*Your written answer for Question 9 goes here.*\n\nQuestion 10 ([Insert Points Here])\n\nConduct a chi-squared test to examine the relationship between cyl (number of cylinders) and am (transmission type). State the null and alternative hypotheses, report the chi-squared statistic and p-value, and interpret the results.\n\n# Perform chi-squared test\n\ntable_cyl_am \\<- table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$am) chisq.test(table_cyl_am)\n\n*Your written answer for Question 10 goes here.*\n\nQuestion 11 ([Insert Points Here])\n\nFit a linear model to predict mpg using wt (weight) and hp (horsepower). Provide the R code, summarize the model, and interpret the coefficients for wt and hp.\n\n# Fit linear model\n\nlinear_model_mpg \\<- lm(mpg \\~ wt + hp, data = mtcars) summary(linear_model_mpg)\n\n*Your written answer for Question 11 goes here.*\n\nQuestion 12 ([Insert Points Here])\n\nFit a logistic regression model to predict am (transmission type) using mpg and wt (weight). Provide the R code, summarize the model, and interpret the odds ratio for mpg.\n\n# Fit logistic model\n\nlogistic_model_am \\<- glm(am \\~ mpg + wt, data = mtcars, family = \"binomial\") summary(logistic_model_am) exp(coef(logistic_model_am))\n\n*Your written answer for Question 12 goes here.*\n\nSection 4: Basic Introduction to Multivariate Analysis This section uses the iris dataset.\n\nQuestion 13 ([Insert Points Here])\n\nBriefly explain the purpose of Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
