This context will introduce you to a real-world problem that is going to be used as a background for the data that you are going to analyse.\n\n\nStep 2 - The dataset\nYou will have access to a pre-built dataset in a .csv format that will contain all the data and metadata needed for your analyses. The data is the same for everyone and I am not providing data on your specific subject of studies.\n\n\nStep 3 - Your Workbook\nYou are going to work on the assessment using your Quarto workbook constructed over the course of the whole module. This is going to be your submission. I’ll collect your exams using a NOW Dropbox where you can paste the link to your published workbook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe dataset and context description for the Summative exam will be shared by the end of the module sessions (probably in the last week of classes)."
