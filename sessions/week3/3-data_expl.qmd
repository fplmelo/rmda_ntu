# Lesson

## What is a scientific hypothesis?

According to the Britannica, a [scientific hypothesis](https://www.britannica.com/science/scientific-hypothesis) is: "... an idea that proposes a tentative explanation about a phenomenon or a narrow set of phenomena observed in the natural world."

**Deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning** are two inseparable but distinct processes within scientific research. They reasonate with each other in a cyclical manner to advance scientific knowledge.

Here's how they connect:

**Inductive reasoning** often initiates the scientific process. It begins with empirical observations of the real world. By noticing patterns in these observations, scientists use inductive reasoning to construct broad generalisations or theories. For example, observing that apples, bananas, and oranges grow on trees might lead to the inductive generalisation that all fruit grows on trees.

Once a **theory** is formulated through inductive reasoning, it then serves as a basis for **deductive reasoning**. Deductive reasoning starts with a generalisation or hypothesis (derived from the theory) and uses it to reach logical conclusions about the real world. If the hypothesis is correct, then the logical conclusions reached through deductive reasoning should also be correct. 

For instance, if the theory is that all living things require energy to survive, then deductive reasoning would lead to the conclusion that ducks, being living things, require energy to survive.

Scientists use deductive reasoning to empirically test the hypotheses that are generated from their inductively developed theories. They design studies and experiments to see if their logical conclusions hold true in the real world.

The results of these deductive tests then feed back into the scientific process. If the results are consistent with the theory (and thus the hypothesis), the theory is supported. However, if the results are not consistent, the theory may need to be modified and refined, leading to the generation of new hypotheses that will again be tested deductively. This creates a circular process where observations lead to theories (**induction**), theories lead to testable predictions (**hypotheses**), and those predictions are tested against further observations (**deduction**), which in turn can refine the theories.
In essence, induction is often about building up from specific observations to broader ideas, while deduction is about breaking down broader ideas into specific, testable predictions. They work together, with inductive reasoning often paving the way for deductive testing, and the outcomes of deductive testing influencing the further development of theories arrived at through induction. Some research approaches, like case studies, lean more heavily on inductive processes, while experimental research often emphasises deductive reasoning.

Scientists use inductive reasoning to formulate theories, which then lead to hypotheses that are tested using deductive reasoning. In essence, science involves both inductive and deductive processes. Research approaches like case studies, which heavily rely on empirical observations and gathering large amounts of data to find interesting patterns and new ideas, are closely associated with inductive processes.

## Research vs Statistical Hypotheses
![](/img/null_vs_stat.png)

A **scientific hypothesis** is a proposed explanation for an observation, phenomenon, or scientific problem. It must be based on observations and make a testable and reproducible prediction about reality. A scientific hypothesis is a provisional idea whose merit requires evaluation and requires further work to either confirm or disprove it. If repeatedly demonstrated to be true by experiment, a scientific hypothesis may become part of a scientific theory. In its essence, a scientific hypothesis aims to be true, adequate, accurate or useful in explaining some natural phenomenon. It guides the types of data we collect and the analyses we conduct.

A **statistical hypothesis**, on the other hand, is specifically used when investigating a possible correlation or similar relation between phenomena. In such cases, the hypothesis that a relation exists is not examined in the same way as a proposed new law of nature. Instead, statistical tests are employed to determine how likely it is that the observed overall effect would occur if the hypothesised relation does not actually exist.

Some key distinctions are:

- Scope and Generality: A scientific hypothesis is often a broader proposed explanation, while a statistical hypothesis is a more specific statement about the relationship between variables that is subjected to statistical testing. For instance, a scientific hypothesis might be that "sunlight is necessary for seeds to grow". A related statistical hypothesis could be that "seeds grown in bags wrapped in aluminium foil will produce shorter plants on average compared to seeds grown in bags not wrapped in foil".

- Method of Evaluation: Scientific hypotheses are evaluated through the broader scientific process, which involves observation, experimentation, and analysis. This can include various research approaches. Statistical hypotheses are specifically evaluated using statistical tests. These tests involve comparing a null hypothesis (typically stating no relation) with an alternative hypothesis (stating a relation exists) and determining the likelihood of the observed data under the null hypothesis. A decision is then made based on a pre-determined significance level.

- Level of Abstraction: Scientific hypotheses often deal with underlying mechanisms or causes of phenomena. Statistical hypotheses are more directly concerned with patterns and relationships within data. The PMC source discusses the TASI model, where statistical assumptions are considered necessary to test an empirical hypothesis which is derived from a theoretical hypothesis using auxiliary assumptions. This highlights that statistical hypotheses are often a step in testing broader scientific ideas.

- Form of Statement: While scientific hypotheses can be verbal or formal (e.g., mathematical models), statistical hypotheses are often formulated in terms of population parameters and distributions, making them amenable to statistical analysis.

:::callout-note
In summary, a scientific hypothesis proposes an explanation for a phenomenon and guides the research process, while a statistical hypothesis is a specific, testable statement about data relationships derived from a scientific hypothesis, which is evaluated using statistical methods. The statistical hypothesis provides a way to quantitatively assess some aspect of the broader scientific hypothesis.
