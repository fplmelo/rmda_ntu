The packages have functions for data wrangling, tidying, reading/writing, parsing, and visualizing, among others. There is a freely available book, [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html), with detailed descriptions and practical examples of the tools available and how they work together. We will explore the basic syntax for working with these packages, as well as, specific functions for data wrangling with the 'dplyr' package and data visualization with the 'ggplot2' package.\n\n![](/img/tidyverse_website.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Tidyverse basics\n\nThe Tidyverse suite of packages introduces users to a set of data structures, functions and operators to make working with data more intuitive, but is slightly different from the way we do things in base R. **Two important new concepts we will focus on are pipes and tibbles**.\n\nBefore we get started with pipes or tibbles, let's load the library:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Pipes\n\nStringing together commands in R can be quite daunting. Also, trying to understand code that has many nested functions can be confusing.\n\nTo make R code more human readable, the Tidyverse tools use the pipe, `%>%`, which was acquired from the `magrittr` package and is now part of the `dplyr` package that is installed automatically with Tidyverse. **The pipe allows the output of a previous command to be used as input to another command instead of using nested functions.**\n\n> **NOTE:** Shortcut to write the pipe is <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>command/ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>\n\nAn example of using the pipe to run multiple commands:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## A single command\nsqrt(83)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 9.110434\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Base R method of running more than one command\nround(sqrt(83), digits = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 9.11\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Running more than one command with piping\nsqrt(83) %>% round(digits = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 9.11\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe pipe represents a much easier way of writing and deciphering R code, and so we will be taking advantage of it, when possible, as we work through the remaining lesson.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Exercises**\n\n1.  Create a vector of random numbers using the code below:\n\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    random_numbers <- c(81, 90, 65, 43, 71, 29)\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n\n2.  Use the pipe (`%>%`) to perform two steps in a single line:\n\n    1.  Take the mean of `random_numbers` using the `mean()` function.\n    2.  Round the output to three digits using the `round()` function.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Tibbles\n\nA core component of the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) is the [tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org/). **Tibbles are a modern rework of the standard `data.frame`, with some internal improvements** to make code more reliable. They are data frames, but do not follow all of the same rules. For example, tibbles can have numbers/symbols for column names, which is not normally allowed in base R.\n\n**Important: [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) is very opininated about row names**. These packages insist that all column data (e.g. `data.frame`) be treated equally, and that special designation of a column as `rownames` should be deprecated. [Tibble](http://tibble.tidyverse.org/) provides simple utility functions to handle rownames: `rownames_to_column()` and `column_to_rownames()`.\n\nTibbles can be created directly using the `tibble()` function or data frames can be converted into tibbles using `as_tibble(name_of_df)`.\n\n> **NOTE:** The function `as_tibble()` will ignore row names, so if a column representing the row names is needed, then the function `rownames_to_column(name_of_df)` should be run prior to turning the data.frame into a tibble. Also, `as_tibble()` will not coerce character vectors to factors by default.\n\n\n## Part 2\n\n\n\n\n{{< revealjs file=\"https://fplmelo.github.io/rmda_ntu/slides/2.2_research_question.html#/title-slide\" height=\"500px\" class=\"ratio ratio-16x9\" >}}\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction: The Logic of Scientific Inquiry\n\nIn science, the pursuit of knowledge often begins with a question about the world around us [1-3]. A well-defined research question acts as the **cornerstone of the scientific process**, guiding investigation and shaping findings [4-6]. The logic underpinning scientific inquiry frequently involves **hypothetico-deductive reasoning**. This approach involves formulating a hypothesis (a testable explanation), and then deducing specific, observable predictions from that hypothesis. The research question, therefore, needs to be framed in a way that allows for the development of such testable hypotheses [7]. It should pinpoint exactly what you want to find out and give your work a clear purpose and focus [6].\n\n## What Makes a \"Sounding\" Research Question?\n\nA \"sounding\" or **strong research question** is one that is carefully constructed to be effective and answerable through systematic investigation [4]. Key characteristics include:\n\n*   **Focused:** It should address a single problem or issue, ensuring that your research remains within a feasible scope [8-10].\n*   **Clear:** The question should be unambiguous and easily understood by your target audience, specifying all necessary details and context [8, 10].\n*   **Specific:** It clearly defines the variables, participants, and context involved, leaving no room for vagueness [8, 10, 11].\n*   **Researchable:** The question must be answerable by collecting empirical data or through existing literature [12, 13].\n*   **Feasible:** The research needed to answer the question should be achievable within the constraints of time, resources, and ethical considerations [2, 8, 13].\n*   **Interesting:** The topic should be engaging to you, and ideally to others in your field [2, 12].\n*   **Novel:** The question should aim to establish new facts or find a new aspect of already established facts, addressing gaps in current knowledge [2, 10, 12, 14].\n*   **Ethical:** The research should not cause harm and should be approved by relevant bodies if necessary [2, 12].\n*   **Relevant:** The answer to the question should be wanted and desired in your field or contribute to society [2, 12, 15].\n*   **Complex:** The question should require analysis and interpretation, rather than a simple yes/no answer or easily found facts [7, 10, 11].\n*   **Arguable:** The question should not be answerable with simple repetition of facts and should allow for different potential answers or perspectives [10].\n*   **Objective:** The question should avoid subjective judgments and focus on measurable or observable aspects [10].\n*   **Appropriate:** The question should align well with the data and methods that can be used to answer it [10].\n\n## Steps to Develop Your Research Question\n\nDeveloping a strong research question is often an iterative process [14, 16, 17]. Here's a step-by-step guide based on the sources:\n\n1.  **Choose a broad topic of interest:** Select a subject that you are passionate about and that is relevant to your field [6, 12, 18].\n2.  **Conduct preliminary research:** Gather background information through a literature review to understand what has already been researched and to identify potential gaps [12, 14, 18, 19]. Pay attention to what questions existing research raises and what authors haven't addressed [1, 20].\n3.  **Narrow down your focus:** Based on your initial research, refine your broad topic to a more specific area that is manageable for your research project [19, 21, 22].\n4.  **Identify a research problem or gap:** Determine what specific issue or unanswered question exists within your narrowed focus [12, 14, 21, 22]. Ask yourself what still needs to be known [21].\n5.  **Formulate initial research questions:** Based on the identified problem or gap, start drafting open-ended \"how\" and \"why\" questions about your specific topic [1, 12, 14, 22].\n6.  **Evaluate and refine your question:** Assess your drafted questions using the criteria for a strong research question outlined earlier [2, 7-14]. Is it focused, clear, specific, researchable, feasible, interesting, novel, ethical, relevant, complex, arguable, objective, and appropriate? Refine the wording to improve clarity and precision [14].\n7.  **Consider the type of research:** Determine whether your question is best suited for exploratory, descriptive, comparative, experimental, qualitative, or quantitative research, as this will influence the phrasing and focus [9, 23-25].\n\n## Examples\n\nHere are a few examples of \"sounding\" research questions:\n\n*   Instead of: \"Are social media bad?\"\n    Try: \"What are the correlations between the frequency of social media use and self-reported levels of anxiety in young adults aged 18-25?\" [25, 26].\n*   Instead of: \"What about climate change?\"\n    Try: \"How has the melting rate of glaciers in the Antarctic Peninsula changed over the past decade, and what are the potential impacts on local penguin populations?\" [26, 27].\n*   Instead of: \"Is online learning effective?\"\n    Try: \"How does student engagement differ between undergraduate students enrolled in fully online courses compared to those in traditional face-to-face courses in higher education?\" [24].\n\n\n\n# Exercise\n\nApproximate time: 60 min\n\n## Penguin Data Wrangling with Tidyverse\n\nObjective: To practice fundamental data wrangling techniques using the dplyr package within the tidyverse on the palmerpenguins dataset. This exercise will cover selecting, filtering, mutating, grouping, and summarizing data to gain insights into the penguin populations.\n\n**Prerequisites**:\n\n• Ensure you have the tidyverse package installed (`install.packages(c(\"tidyverse\",\"palmerpenguins\"))`).\n\n• Load the tidyverse library at the beginning of your R session (`library(tidyverse)`). This will automatically load dplyr and the `palmerpenguins` dataset.\n\n**Instructions**:\n\n1. Inspect the Data: Begin by examining the penguins dataset. Use the `glimpse()` function from dplyr to get a concise overview of the dataset's structure, including the column names and data types. You can also use `head()` to view the first few rows.\n\n2. Select Relevant Columns: For this exercise, we will focus on the species and the physical measurements of the penguins. Use the `select()` function to create a new tibble named penguin_measurements containing only the species, island, bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, and body_mass_g columns.\n\n3. Handle Missing Data: Notice that there might be missing values (represented as NA) in the body_mass_g column. Use the `filter()` function along with `!is.na()` to create a new tibble named penguin_no_na that excludes rows where body_mass_g is NA. The exclamation mark `!` negates the condition, so we are keeping the rows where body_mass_g is not missing.\n\n4. Create a New Variable: The body_mass_g is currently in grams. Use the `mutate()` function to add a new column named body_mass_kg that converts the body mass to kilograms (1 kg = 1000 g).\n\n5. Group Data: To compare the physical characteristics of different penguin populations, use the `group_by()` function to group the penguin_with_kg tibble by both species and island. This will prepare the data for summary calculations within each group.\n\n6. Summarize Data: Now, use the `summarise()` function to calculate the mean bill length, mean bill depth, mean flipper length, and mean body mass (in kg) for each group created in the previous step. Name the new summary columns mean_bill_length_mm, mean_bill_depth_mm, mean_flipper_length_mm, and mean_body_mass_kg respectively.\n\n7. Arrange the Results: Finally, use the `arrange()` function to sort the penguin_summary tibble first by island and then by mean_body_mass_kg in descending order (largest mean body mass first). You can use the `desc()` function within `arrange()` for descending order.\n\n8. View the Output: Print the final_summary tibble to see the results of your data wrangling steps.\n\n\n### Further Exploration (Optional):\n\n• Try filtering for a specific species or island before grouping and summarizing.\n\n• Use the `count()` function to see the number of observations in each group before calculating the mean.\n\n• Experiment with creating other new variables using `mutate()`, such as the ratio of bill length to bill depth.\n\nThis exercise provides a hands-on introduction to several key data wrangling verbs in dplyr, demonstrating how to transform and summarize data effectively within the tidyverse framework. The use of the pipe operator `%>%` allows for a more readable and sequential flow of data manipulation.\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow that we have our results ready for plotting, we can use the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) package to plot our results. If you are interested, you can follow [this lesson](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Tidyverse_ggplot2/lessons/03_ggplot2.html) and dive into how to use `ggplot2` to create the plots with this dataset.\n\n### Additional resources\n\n-   [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz)\n-   [teach the tidyverse](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/)\n-   [tidy style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/)\n\n\n**References used in this post**\n\n1.
