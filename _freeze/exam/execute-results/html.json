You may use any resources available to you (notes, books, online documentation).\n\n-   You are expected to work individually. Collaboration is not permitted.\n\n-   All code and answers must be clearly presented in this document.\n\n-   Ensure this document renders successfully to both an HTML and a PDF file.\n\n-   Show all your work, including the R code used to arrive at your answers.\n\n# Section 1: Data Wrangling\n\nThis section uses the `dataset`, which contains data about various car models.\n\n### Step 1 - Load the database\n\nLoad the dataset\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Place your code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nInspect the dataset for basic characteristics such as type of variables, dimensions of the dataset, etc.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Place your code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Step 2 - Data wrangling\n\n-   Create a new variable based on an existing one\n\nThe `am` column in the `mtcars` dataset represents the transmission type (0 = automatic, 1 = manual). Create a new factor variable called `transmission_type` based on the am column to acheive the result below:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n                  am transmission_type\nMazda RX4          1            Manual\nMazda RX4 Wag      1            Manual\nDatsun 710         1            Manual\nHornet 4 Drive     0         Automatic\nHornet Sportabout  0         Automatic\nValiant            0         Automatic\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Create transmission_type\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Place your code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Step 3 - Data Summarisation\n\nCalculate the mean mpg (miles per gallon) for cars with 4 cylinders (cyl) and for cars with 6 cylinders.\n\n- Calculate mean `mpg` for 4 and 6 cylinder cars\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 Ã— 2\n    cyl mean_mpg\n  <dbl>    <dbl>\n1     4     26.7\n2     6     19.7\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Place your code here\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4 (\\[Insert points here\\])\n\nFilter the data to include only observations where the car has a manual transmission and has more than 4 gears. How many observations meet these criteria?\n\nmanual_and_more_than_4_gears \\<- mtcars %\\>% filter(am == 1 & gear \\> 4) nrow(manual_and_more_than_4_gears)\n\nYour answer here\n\nSection 2: Data Visualization This section continues to use the mtcars dataset.\n\nQuestion 5 (\\[Insert Points Here\\])\n\nCreate a scatter plot showing the relationship between mpg and wt (weight). Add appropriate labels for the axes and a title for the plot.\n\n# Create scatter plot of mpg vs wt\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + labs(title = \"Relationship between MPG and Weight\", x = \"Weight (1000 lbs)\", y = \"MPG\")\n\n*Your written answer for Question 5 goes here.*\n\nQuestion 6 (\\[Insert Points Here\\])\n\nGenerate a boxplot to visualize the distribution of mpg across different cyl (number of cylinders) values.\n\n# Create boxplot of mpg by cyl\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(title = \"MPG Distribution by Number of Cylinders\", x = \"Number of Cylinders\", y = \"MPG\")\n\n*Your written answer for Question 6 goes here.*\n\nQuestion 7 (\\[Insert Points Here\\])\n\nCreate a bar chart showing the count of cars for each number of cylinders (cyl).\n\n# Create bar chart of cylinder counts\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) + geom_bar() + labs(title = \"Car Count by Number of Cylinders\", x = \"Number of Cylinders\", y = \"Count\")\n\n*Your written answer for Question 7 goes here.*\n\nSection 3: Basic Statistics This section uses the mtcars dataset.\n\nQuestion 8 (\\[Insert Points Here\\])\n\nPerform an independent samples t-test to compare the mean mpg for cars with automatic and manual transmissions. State the null and alternative hypotheses, report the p-value, and interpret the results.\n\n# Perform t-test\n\nt.test(mpg \\~ am, data = mtcars)\n\n*Your written answer for Question 8 goes here.*\n\nQuestion 9 (\\[Insert Points Here\\])\n\nCalculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between mpg and hp (horsepower). Interpret the strength and direction of the correlation.\n\n# Calculate correlation\n\ncor(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$hp)\n\n*Your written answer for Question 9 goes here.*\n\nQuestion 10 (\\[Insert Points Here\\])\n\nConduct a chi-squared test to examine the relationship between cyl (number of cylinders) and am (transmission type). State the null and alternative hypotheses, report the chi-squared statistic and p-value, and interpret the results.\n\n# Perform chi-squared test\n\ntable_cyl_am \\<- table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$am) chisq.test(table_cyl_am)\n\n*Your written answer for Question 10 goes here.*\n\nQuestion 11 (\\[Insert Points Here\\])\n\nFit a linear model to predict mpg using wt (weight) and hp (horsepower). Provide the R code, summarize the model, and interpret the coefficients for wt and hp.\n\n# Fit linear model\n\nlinear_model_mpg \\<- lm(mpg \\~ wt + hp, data = mtcars) summary(linear_model_mpg)\n\n*Your written answer for Question 11 goes here.*\n\nQuestion 12 (\\[Insert Points Here\\])\n\nFit a logistic regression model to predict am (transmission type) using mpg and wt (weight).
