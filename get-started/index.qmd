**For Mac OS X**:

-   **Drag and drop the R application into the `Applications` folder.**

**For Windows**:

-   Go to the official R website and select **"Download R for Windows"**.
-   Select **"base"**, as this is your first installation of R.
-   Follow the **standard instructions for installing programs for Windows**. If prompted to select "Customize Startup" or "Accept Default Startup Options", **choose the default options**.

**For Linux/Ubuntu**:

-   Go to the official R website and select **"Download R for Linux"**.
-   Select the **"Ubuntu"** option.

#### 2. Install RStudio

Once R is installed on your computer, you can proceed to install RStudio.

Once both R and RStudio are installed, you can launch RStudio. **It's important to open RStudio, not just R**, to access the integrated environment. You can usually find RStudio by searching on your desktop and it's recommended to pin the RStudio icon to your preferred location for easy access.

Congratulations, you have now successfully installed R and RStudio! You are ready to begin your data science journey.
